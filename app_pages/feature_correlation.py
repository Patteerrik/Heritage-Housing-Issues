            "Hereâ€™s how they impact the sale prices:"
            "\n- **OverallQual (0.79 correlation)**: This suggests a strong positive correlation, indicating that higher overall quality significantly increases the sale price."
            "\n- **GrLivArea (0.71 correlation)** and **TotalBsmtSF (0.61 correlation)**: Larger living areas and basement sizes are also positively correlated with higher sale prices, confirming that buyers value more spacious homes."
            "\n- **GarageArea (0.61 correlation)**: Similarly, a larger garage space contributes positively to the home's value."
            "\n- **YearRemodAdd (0.51 correlation)**: Recent remodels add to the sale price, suggesting that newer features or updates are important to buyers."

    # Methodology
    st.write("#### Methodology")
    st.info(
        "The correlation was calculated using Pearson's correlation coefficient, which shows how strongly the features are related to the sale price."
        " A positive correlation means that as the feature value increases, the sale price also tends to increase."
